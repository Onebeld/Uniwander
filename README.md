A new game powered by the Godot game engine version 4.0.2

## Gameplay idea

Before the game starts, the player will be asked to create a new galaxy. It is possible to select several galaxy options, and on further playthrough you can travel to other galaxies, including discovering secret ones that are not available in the menu for selecting galaxies.

After creating a galaxy, the player will be prompted on which star system the game will begin, and a choice of game mode will appear:

- Colonist: The player will control his colony and its expansion. Resource gathering is simple here, as the colonies mine them themselves.
- Wanderer: The player will not have his own colony and will have to gather resources and money by himself.

Further gameplay may be similar to the Cosmos phase of Electronic Arts' Spore game - exploring planets, terraforming, etc.

In order to extract some gas, it is necessary to collect in the Gas Giants. The player will have the opportunity to fly over the Gas Giant, but not too low, as high pressure can damage the spaceship. To establish a colony on the Gas Giants you will need a separate tool that allows you to create colonies hovering over the planet. To gather gas alone requires either a special hovering device or a tool (which wastes a lot of energy).

There will also be a story, communication, and battles in the game (not yet invented).

If the game ever gets multiplayer, players can team up and create their own empire. It will be along the lines of creating your own country with its own rules (e.g., only use diplomacy, not weapons). It will be possible to create your own server to play together, and it will be possible to log in to the server with an IP and password.
