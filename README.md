# Uniwander
Uniwander - new indie game. You could call it "the spiritual successor to the space stage from the game Spore".

### Why did I want to create this game in this particular direction?
I absolutely love the space stage from Spore. But since that stage can be boring, and there are no games of those types, I decided to make it myself.

### What's going to be in the game?
- Traveling to other galaxies;
- Colonization of planets and gas giants;
- Multiplayer;
- And much more.
